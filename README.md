Rugby scraper
=============

At the moment this scraper doesnt do much, except for getting and printing the
current table in both [National Rugby League (NRL)](http://www.nrl.com/) and 
[Super League](http://www.rugby-league.com/superleague) to stdout. 
Eventually it will be doing some more fancy stuff.

The National Rugby League is the top league of professional rugby league
clubs in Australasia. It contains 15 clubs based in Australia and one based in
New Zealand.

Super League is the top English professional rugby league competition.
It currently contains eleven teams from England as well as one team based in
France.
