NRL crawler
===========

Crawls the [NRL](http://www.nrl.com/).
The National Rugby League (NRL) is the top league of professional rugby league
clubs in Australasia. It contains 15 clubs based in Australia and one based in
New Zealand.

At the moment this crawler doesnt do much, except for printing the ladder to
stdout. Eventually it will do some more fancy stuff.
